<p>I’ve never been let down by any <a href="https://fivewattcoffee.com/">Five Watt</a> shop. I love their specialty drinks. They don’t make them overly sweet, but fun with just the kind of spices that I love. Put coriander in something and my antennae perk up.</p>
<p>Today, I came to the location in Kingfield neighborhood. This intersection has got a handful of great restaurants in addition to Five Watt. I went to the counter and the barista popped over instantly. I asked if they had any gibralter-sized specialty drinks. They didn’t, but the barista said they’d make me something. “Want a pumpkin?” they said. Indeed I would. The drink was ready in just the time it took me to put my bag down and it was a perfect mini-pumpkin latte. Not too sweet and very yummy.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I had a great time at the <a href="https://nawrs.org/">NAWRS</a> 2023 Workshop in Salt Lake City, Utah. I’m more than a little biased because I am on the board of NAWRS and was the program co-chair. I had a lot to do with the the call for proposals, the selection of the presentation, and the organization. I was really happy with how it all turned out. People were having conversations about public assistance and research, how to respectively learn with participants, and how to put programs into practice.</p>
<p>I was part of three sessions. My first was organized my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ladonna-pavetti-2002ab44">Donna Pavetti</a>, giant of TANF research and fascinating person. She brought TANF researchers and policy people together from Minnesota, Utah, and Washington to talk about what we’ve been doing in outcome measurement for TANF. I talked a lot about the <a href="https://mn.gov/dhs/partners-and-providers/news-initiatives-reports-workgroups/economic-supports-cash-food/#11">Self-Support Index</a>, which was my primary work while I was at the Minnesota Department of Human Service. My Utah and Washington colleagues spoke about employment data and using <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/performance/performance-indicators">WIOA measures</a> for TANF. We had a great discussion with the attendees, talking about data availability, and collaborating with local partners.</p>
<p>My second session was organized my <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/about/richard-hendra">Rick Hendra</a> of MDRC to talk about the TANF Data Collaborative (<a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/opre/report/tanf-data-collaborative-pilot-profiles-collection-data-analytics-projects-state-county">ACF report</a>, <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/publication/tanf-data-collaborative-pilot-profiles">pilot profiles</a>, <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/opre/training-technical-assistance/improving-outcomes-families-through-better-use-data-tanf-data">video</a>, and <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/project/tanf-data-innovation#overview">MDRC page</a>). I was back with my colleagues from Utah. Rick gave an overview of the programs and Nycole (Utah) and I (Minnesota) talked about our pilots. We had a very engaged group and it was a pleasure to talk about our work exploring the relationship between participant racial identity and sanctions.</p>
<p>My last session was about Minnesota’s Emergency SNAP implementation. I did a lot of data work on the program and was very excited to go into the gory data details with people. You can find the slides for the presentation <a href="https://bpffjl.github.io/esnap-nawrs">here</a>.</p>
<p>We had a fun time in Utah. It’s rare for researchers in local governments to have a chance to get together to talk about their work. NAWRS was a great opportunity to share and learn from each other as always.</p>

  <title>Cafe Astoria</title>

<p>I’m taking a week long staycation between jobs and trying out different coffee shops in the Twin Cities. Yesterday, I went to <a href="http://www.caffettocafe.com/">Caffetto</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I’ve gone the other direction into Saint Paul to check out <a href="https://cafeastoria-stpaul.com/">Cafe Astoria</a>. They’ve got an extensive cafe menu and these beautiful rainbow lattes. I was tempted by the rainbow lattes, but decided to go with my usual drink, a cortado. What I got is certainly the <em>largest</em> cortado, I’ve ever seen. More like a small latte than the equal parts espresso and steamed milk that I was expecting. That said, it was very tasty - smooth, sweet, and perfectly warm.</p>

<p>If I’m in this neighborhood, I’ll certainly keep this spot in mind for coffee or lunch.</p>

<p>I love the vibe of <a href="http://www.caffettocafe.com/">Caffetto</a>. It’s not sleek or pristine. From my view I can see walls painted red and gold, covered with paintings by local artists. Cabinets are stuffed with piles or board games. A creepy bust sits by the window next to a pink lamp and two figurines. The music is old-sounding Americana, which probably isn’t to old.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m pretty underwhelmed by the coffee. My cappuccino is harsh and tastes of charred wood. The drink was prepared by holding back the foam in the steaming pitcher and pouring the hot milk into the espresso. Then the foamy was scooped on top. That’s never been my favorite way to make a cappuccino, but I was open to seeing what it tasted like. The first sip was all sweet foam. When i tried again and got some coffee, it tasted bitter and thick.</p>
